K&R C
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language.[19] 
Known as K&R from the initials of its authors, 
the book served for many years as an informal specification of the language. 
The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "K&R C". 
As this was released in 1978, it is also referred to as C78.
The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard, described below.
