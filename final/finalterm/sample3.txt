ANSI C and ISO C
During the late 1970s and 1980s, 
versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of mainframe computers, 
minicomputers, and microcomputers, including the IBM PC, 
as its popularity began to increase significantly.
In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee, 
X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. 
X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; 
however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the IEEE 
working group 1003 
to become the basis for the 1988 POSIX standard. 
In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C". 
This version of the language is often referred to as ANSI C, Standard C, or 
sometimes C89.
In 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the 
International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. 
Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to the same programming language.

GCC was first released March 22, 1987, available by FTP from MIT.[18] Stallman was 
listed as the author but cited others for their contributions, including Tower for 
"parts of the parser, RTL generator, RTL definitions, and of the Vax machine 
description", Jack Davidson and Christopher W. Fraser for the idea of using RTL as 
an intermediate language, and Paul Rubin for writing most of the preprocessor.[19] 
Described as the "first free software hit" by Peter H. Salus, the GNU compiler 
arrived just at the time when Sun Microsystems was unbundling its development tools 
from its operating system, selling them separately at a higher combined price than 
the previous bundle, which led many of Sun's users to buy or download GCC instead of 
the vendor's tools.[20] While Stallman considered GNU Emacs as his main project, by 
1990 GCC supported thirteen computer architectures, was outperforming several vendor 
compilers, and was used commercially by several companies.[21]
