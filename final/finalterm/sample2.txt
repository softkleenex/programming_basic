The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) (formerly GNU C Compiler) is a collection of 
compilers from the GNU Project that support various programming languages, hardware 
architectures, and operating systems. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes 
GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC is a key 
component of the GNU toolchain which is used for most projects related to GNU and 
the Linux kernel. With roughly 15 million lines of code in 2019, GCC is one of the 
largest free programs in existence.[4] It has played an important role in the growth 
of free software, as both a tool and an example.

When it was first released in 1987 by Richard Stallman, GCC 1.0 was named the GNU C 
Compiler since it only handled the C programming language.[1] It was extended to 
compile C++ in December of that year. Front ends were later developed for 
Objective-C++, Fortran, Go, D, Modula-2, Rust and COBOL among others.[6] 
The OpenMP and OpenACC specifications are also supported in the C and C++ 
compilers.[7][8]

As well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system, GCC has been 
adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern Unix-like computer operating 
systems, including most Linux distributions. Most BSD family operating systems also 
switched to GCC shortly after its release, although since then, FreeBSD and Apple 
macOS have moved to the Clang compiler,[9] largely due to licensing 
reasons.[10][11][12] GCC can also compile code for Windows, Android, iOS, Solaris, 
HP-UX, AIX, and MS-DOS compatible operating systems.[13]
